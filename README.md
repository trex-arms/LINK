# T.REX ARMS LINK

The LINK hole pattern is a mounting system designed to be compatible with the maximum number of holsters and quick release adapters on the market. Some configurations also have multiple ride heights and cant angles.
 
While it was designed to offer the most flexibility when paired with our previously [open-sourced Ragnarok hole pattern](https://github.com/trex-arms/ragnarok), it supports a wide range of products from Safariland, Blackhawk, Bladetech, G-Code, Aliengear, Tenicor, and many more.
 
Since this particular hole pattern has been in development for so long, we have included not just our final iteration (v4), but three previous versions that we tested along the way, just to provide a little more insight into the development process. Over the last several years we have gone from basic to relatively complex designs and back, often running into material constraints that prevent longer slots or too many holes.
 
We've experimented with different plastics, laser-cut metal inserts, and other variables as we tweaked the hole pattern itself. Our final and fourth revision managed to be an ideal compromise, especially when paired with a relatively rigid nylon, and screws with wider heads. Based on our tests we offer the following recommendations:

### Prototyping
If you would like to tinker with 3D printed mounts, stick with thicker designs and more rigid filaments or resins to prevent hardware from pulling through the longer slots. More flexible plastics may need reinforcement to prevent the fasteners from twisting out of the mount. We do _not_ recommend 3D printing these designs for any purposes beyond prototyping, as in our tests the 3D printed materials were not able to meet our durability and strength standards.

### Final Product
During our prototyping we learned that many common plastics were either too brittle and cracked under stress or they were too flexible, leading to screw heads easily tearing through the part when pulling on the holster. The specific nylon 6/6 chosen for our production LINK achieved the balance of rigidity and durability we were looking for. If you would like a rock solid final product, you can order an injection molded [LINK from T.Rex Arms](https://www.trex-arms.com/store/t-rex-link/), which comes with a collection of stainless steel hardware and rubber washers for installing a wide range of holsters and adapters.

### Future Products
If you would like to use the LINK hole pattern to develop your own personal or commercial products, it is released under the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), so it can be used in any way. We hope that other manufacturers are able to build on the results of our experimentation, and use this hole pattern to bring wider support and greater interoperability across the entire firearm industry.
